A poet couldn't help but feel happy in their lively presence. As the speaker watched them, they didn't realize at the time how much this experience would mean to them."

For so many strange contrasts in one human face:
There's thought and no thought, and there's paleness and bloom
And bustle and sluggishness, pleasure and gloom.",A Character,"It is amazing to me how Nature can fit so many opposing qualities into one human face. There can be both intelligence and vacancy, as well as both a lack of color and a bright radiance. There can be both energy and lethargy, as well as both happiness and sadness."

Perhaps he's gone along the dell,
And carried Johnny to the wood.",The Idiot Boy,"She had a sudden idea that the Pony, who was always gentle and well-treated, might have wandered off towards the valley, possibly with Johnny on his back, towards the woods."

The last of all her thoughts would be
To drown herself therein.",The Idiot Boy,"She suddenly stands up, as if she has wings. She doesn't consider the idea of committing a deadly sin anymore. Even if she were to come across fifty pounds, she wouldn't even think about drowning herself in it."

What they've been doing all this time,

A fierce and dreadful hunter he;
Yon valley, now so trim and green,
In five months' time, should he be seen,
A desert wilderness will be!",The Idiot Boy,"The speaker suggests that a fierce hunter, who may be hunting sheep, is now present in the valley. The valley currently appears green and neat, but in five months' time, it will become a desolate wilderness due to the hunter's actions."

He surely met with strange adventures.",The Idiot Boy,"For fourteen years, I have been devoted to the Muses, bound by a strong commitment. Oh, kind Muses, allow me to recount only a portion of the unusual experiences he encountered, for they were truly remarkable."
wordsworth-68,https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-idiot-boy-2/,"O gentle Muses! is this kind?
Why will ye thus my suit repel?
Why of your further aid bereave me?
And can ye thus unfriended leave me
Ye Muses! whom I love so well?",The Idiot Boy,"The speaker addresses the Muses and expresses disappointment at their lack of assistance.

Of moon or stars he takes no heed;
Of such we in romances read:
--'Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live.",The Idiot Boy,"He appears to be letting his horse eat without restriction, without paying attention to the moon or stars, similar to what one may read in romantic stories. It is indeed Johnny, as the speaker exclaims."
wordsworth-68,https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/the-idiot-boy-2/,"And that's the very Pony, too!

And, for my chance-acquaintance, ladies bright,
Sons, mothers, maidens withering on the stalk,
These all wear out of me, like Forms, with chalk
Painted on rich men's floors, for one feast-night.
Better than such discourse doth silence long,
Long, barren silence, square with my desire;
To sit without emotion, hope, or aim,
In the loved presence of my cottage-fire,
And listen to the flapping of the flame,
Or kettle whispering its faint undersong.",Personal Talk,"I am not someone who enjoys talking about personal matters while sitting by the fire. I do not like to discuss my friends who are nearby or the people I casually meet. These people are like temporary shapes that fade away quickly, leaving no impression on me.

Even be it so; yet still among your tribe,
Our daily world's true Worldlings, rank not me!
Children are blest, and powerful; their world lies
More justly balanced; partly at their feet,

He is a Slave; the meanest we can meet!",Personal Talk,"The speaker acknowledges that life is to be experienced and enjoyed, and that sometimes even mischievous behavior can invigorate the mind. However, the speaker does not want to be considered part of the everyday world, where people are focused solely on themselves and their own perceptions. The speaker believes that children have a better understanding of the world around them, with a balance of what is within their control and what is not. The speaker also values the beauty of things that are distant and inaccessible, as they can evoke a greater sense of emotion. The speaker warns that anyone who only sees the world through their own eyes is a slave to their own limited perspective."

Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,
Our pastime and our happiness will grow.

Love in young people is often simply a strong passion, while in old age it can become an obsession. The more one loves, the more it can damage them."

Love acts according to its own will and does not follow any logical reasoning, which is why it can be both a source of comfort and torment."

They believe that they must remain free or die, as they speak the same language as Shakespeare and hold the same values as Milton.

O rest, thou doleful Mother of Mankind!'
A Spirit sang in tones more plaintive than the wind:
'From regions where no evil thing has birth
I come--thy stains to wash away,
Thy cherished fetters to unbind,
And open thy sad eyes upon a milder day.
The Heavens are thronged with martyrs that have risen
From out thy noisome prison;
The penal caverns groan
With tens of thousands rent from off the tree
Of hopeful life,--by battle's whirlwind blown
Into the deserts of Eternity.
Unpitied havoc! Victims unlamented!
But not on high, where madness is resented,
And murder causes some sad tears to flow,
Though, from the widely-sweeping blow,
The choirs of Angels spread, triumphantly augmented.","Invocation To The Earth, February 1816","A spirit sings a mournful song to the Earth, urging it to rest and find peace. The spirit comes from a place where evil does not exist and wants to cleanse the Earth of its stains and free it from the chains that bind it. The spirit promises a better future and reveals that the heavens are filled with martyrs who have risen from the Earth's prison. The Earth is filled with victims of war who have been cast into the deserts of eternity without pity or lamentation. The murders and destruction caused by humanity do not go unnoticed by the heavens, but the angels continue to spread triumphantly despite the devastation."

The beauty of life's early moments, such as the refreshing breeze and dew of the morning, and the sweet fragrance of love, are fleeting and easily lost. This highlights the limited amount of joy that humans are able to experience in their lives, which fades away like the beauty of a sunset cloud."
