'Think of a world without the thought of afterlife! br> Not hard to imagine, if thou would'st; br> No place of eternal punishment beneath us, br> No endless sky above; br> Think of all the men who would live in the present, br> And not think of the afterlife.
'Think of a world without borders, br> Where no violence, no sacrifice, br> In name of nationalism or religion, br> Can be made; where men may live in peace, br> Free from division and hate.' br> This vision of a united humanity, br> Is a message of hope, br> A call to action, for all who wish br> To leave a better world for the generations to come.
'I'm an idealist,' he says, br> 'but I'm not alone in my wish; br> And I pray that one day br> My dream of a world of peace will be wrought.
Imagine a world without possessions, can you? br> Where avarice and hunger are absent, br> And brotherhood reigns among men; br> A world where all share the world's wealth.
'I may be thought a dreamer, br> Or a man of ill-conceived thoughts; br> But I know not that I am the only one br> Who thinks thus; and I pray br> That all men, in this world, br> Shall live in peace, br> Whether they be right or wrong.
'Something has happened, but I know not why; br> And, if I do my best, it may not change the course; br> I say these words to clarify the matter at a later hour. br> Time is a thing of great importance; br> How swiftly it passes, and how it marks the end of each day; br> And, with the pendulum, I say, br> That life is ticking away.
I could not believe what was happening; br> I did not see it coming, and before I knew it br> Time had slipped away;--I clung on, but in vain; br> All I had, I lost, to see thee depart; br> I kept my feelings in my breast, br> But all fell apart; and what we had br> Will be a memory of a time when things were different.
And all that I did, all that I did, br> Was vain; all my labour was vain; br> And, though I tried my best, my labour did not yield br> The desired result; I had to lose, and fall, br> But it did not matter a whit.
And yet I did succeed, br> Despite the mocking and the sneering br> Of others; and this rhyme br> I made to remind me of my steadfastness; br> And, though the memory br> Of them who fought against me hath faded, br> I am a different man; br> Yet the pain of my failed attempts br> Is still there; br> It will be a memory of a time br> When I tried so hard, and could not hold it together.
And, though all my efforts were vain, br> I put in a lot of time and energy, br> But, in the end, all was vain; br> And, though I had to be beaten down, br> To see that, it did not matter.
I have put my trust in thee, br> And given all that I had, and pushed myself to the limit; br> But one message I must convey, br> And I hope that you will understand.
And I did much, and did much, br> But, in the end, all that I did, br> Was vain; all that I did, br> All that I did, all that I did, br> Was vain.
