'Beside the landscape-ground, we see her seated, br> Her hands in her lap folded, br> In a gown simple, yet elegant; br> Her face is framed by long, wavy hair; br> And first of all, her gaze, br> Which seems to follow you wherever you go, br> As if she were alive and conscious.
The woman's face is a shade of sage, br> As if there were some deeper meaning br> To her smile; her lips are parted br> A little, a hint of white teeth; br> Her eyes are large and enticing; br> And her face, painted, is almost luminous.
'Tis not long before you see the finer things br> That da Vinci has wrought; br> From the folds of her dress, br> To the subtle shading of her skin, br> Every part of the picture is wrought br> With a realist's touch; br> And the hills behind her, br> And the winding rivers, draw the eye br> Deeper into the painting.
Dark blue sky, dotted with swirling stars br> Of yellow and white, that seem to twinkle, br> As if they were alive and pulsing; br> And the sky, too, with broad strokes, is full of motion.
In the foreground, among the rolling hills, br> We see a village, with its little houses, br> And its church, which, against the sky, br> Stand out in stark contrast. br> The buildings are of a pale hue, br> Green and brown, which blend in with the green; br> And the brushstrokes are rough and jagged, br> Which add to the feeling of motion and energy.
The stars, whose arcs seem to sway, br> Are a riot of whirlwinds and whirlwinds; br> And the moon, in the upper right, br> Is a glowing orb, almost a part of the sky.
The couple, in passionate embrace, br> The man in her arms; br> The swirling sea of patterns and colors, br> With golden designs that seem to pulsate, br> Is shown in the painting.
The woman in a golden robe br> Is twirling, the man in a deep blue tunic; br> Their bodies are joined, their faces pressed br> In a tender kiss; br> His hands are on the woman's back, br> Her hands round his neck are tied.
The most striking thing about the painting br> Is the way in which it catches the fervor of the hour; br> Every part of it is designed to evoke br> The feeling of love, from the way the bodies are entwined, br> To the swirling colors.
The patterns themselves are fine, and rich, br> With golden swirls ornate, that seem br> To have a life of their own; br> As if the couple were caught in a whirlwind br> Of feeling and feeling.
The painting shows the moment in Genesis br> When God reached out his hand to bind br> Adam's life to his own; br> And it is on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, br> In Vatican City, a work of a size and a detail br> Of a marvellous size.
And in the center of the painting, God, br> An old bearded Man, in flowing robes, br> Is seen, surrounded by a multitude of angels, br> Who seem to move and swirl round him; br> And God's outstretched hand, br> Reaching to touch the hand of Adam, br> A muscular, idealized figure.
The figures are set against a mighty sky, br> With swirling clouds, and dark blues and greens, br> Which add to the grandeur of the scene; br> And each muscle and sinew is rendered br> With care and skill.
The painting is famous for the moment of creation, br> The outstretched hand of God br> The moment of divine inspiration, br> The spark of life that sets Adam in motion; br> And for the drama of its figures, br> And its sprightly composition.
